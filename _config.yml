  The activity of a complex network of billions of interconnected neurons underlies our ability
  to sense, represent and store the details of experienced life, and enables us to interact
  with our environment and other organisms. Modern neuroscience techniques enable us to access
  this activity, and thus to begin to understand the processes whereby individual neurons work
  together to enable complex behaviors. In order to increase this understanding and to design
  biomedical systems which might therapeutically interact with neural circuits, advanced
  statistical signal processing and machine learning approaches are required. This class will
  cover a range of techniques and their application to basic neuroscience and neural
  interfaces.
  This class will cover a range of techniques and their application to basic neuroscience and
  neural interfaces. Topics include an introduction to neurobiology and electrophysiology for
  engineers, point processes, dimensionality reduction, classification/clustering, spectral
  analysis, and genetic and optical tools for interrogating neural circuits. Neuroscience
  applications include modeling action potentials and firing rates, automated analysis of
  activity-dependent fluorescence imaging data, decoding, spike sorting, and field potential
  analysis. This course is open to students with no prior neurobiology coursework.
