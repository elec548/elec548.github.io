# _ELEC 548 / 483 Syllabus - 2020_

This course covers advanced statistical signal processing and machine learning approaches for
modern neuroscience data (primarily many-channel spike trains).  Topics include latent variable
models, point processes, Bayesian inference, dimensionality reduction, dynamical systems, and
spectral analysis. Neuroscience applications include modeling neural firing rates, spike
sorting, decoding, characterization of neural systems, and field potential analysis.

## Instructor: [Caleb Kemere](http://rnel.rice.edu/people/calebkemere)

## Graders: [TBD]()

## Location: BRC28r46

## Time: Tuesdays/Thursdays 9:40-11 AM

## Prerequisites: 
Basic circuits (ELEC 242 or equivalent), Probability (ELEC 303 or equivalent), Linear algebra
(Math 355 or equivalent), Python will be used for many of the homework assignments so some
familiarity with scientific program is critical. While we will introduce a variety of machine
learning topics in class, students may find prior knowledge of machine learning concepts (e.g.,
ELEC475, ELEC476, STAT413 and/or COMP540) helpful.

## Objective:
Students should learn the fundamentals of how the activity of neurons represents information
within in the brain, how this activity can be monitored experimentally, and how to decode
underlying information from the resulting neural data.

## Outcome: 
Students completing the course should be able to:

  + Students are comfortable with neural data in many different forms,
    including “spikes” measured intracellularly, extracellularly, optically,
    and LFP/EEG.

  + Students are comfortable building generative models that describe neural
    activity either from first principles or using experimental data.

  + Students are comfortable using generative models to optimally decode
    underlying information from neural activity.



## Grading:
Class grade will be based on homework assignments and the final project. You are welcome to
work on homework in groups. However, for 1 assignments of your choice (not including the
first), you must be responsible for a significant majority of the content and include a
statement to that effect. Students enrolled in 483 may work on their final projects in groups,
but students enrolled in 548 are expected to work on them independently.

  + 6-8 ~weekly homework assignments (70%)
  + final project (30%) (students enrolled in 483 may do final project as a team)
