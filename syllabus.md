# _Syllabus_

## Instructor: [Caleb Kemere](http://rnel.rice.edu/people/calebkemere)

## Graders: Shayok Dutta, Hamed Rahmani

## Location: BRC286

## Time: Tuesdays/Thursdays 9:25-10:40

## Prerequisites: 
Basic circuits (ELEC 242 or equivalent), Probability (ELEC 303 or equivalent), Linear algebra
(Math 355 or equivalent), Matlab will be used for many of the homework assignments so some
familiarity with it will be useful

## Objective:
Students should learn the fundamentals of how the activity of neurons represents information
within in the brain, how this activity can be monitored experimentally, and how to decode
underlying information from the resulting neural data.

## Outcome: 
Students completing the course should be able to:

  + Explain the fundamentals of neural information processing
  + Mathematically model the electrophysiological behavior of neurons
  + Extract information from neural data


## Grading:
Class grade will be based on homework assignments and the final project. You are welcome to
work on homework (and final project) in groups. However, for 1 assignments of your choice (not
including the first), you must be responsible for a significant majority of the content and
include a statement to that effect.

  + 6-8 ~weekly homework assignments (70%)
  + final project (30%)
