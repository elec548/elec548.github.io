## Homework 1 (20 pts)

_This problem set is due Tuesday (9/6/2016) at 5pm. Please turn in your work by uploading to
Canvas. If you have questions, please post them on the course forum, rather than emailing the
course staff. This will allow other students with the same question to see the response and any
ensuing discussion. The goal of this problem set is to review the concept that complex
operations involve distributed action in the brain and to think about how best we can
understand the process of cortical computaiton._


1. _Organization of the brain - short answer (a few sentences, 5 pts)_
   In the 1860s, Pierre Paul Broca described how patients with lesions in the posterior left
   frontal lobe (what is now called “Broca’s area”) were capable of understanding language but
   not speaking.  

   How do the symptoms of lesions in Wernicke’s area differ from those in Broca’s area?

   What happens to deaf patients ability to communicate in sign language when they suffer
   damage to Broca’s or Wernicke’s areas?

2. _The Stroop Effect (5 pts)_ Please take the Stroop effect test at
   [http://www.math.unt.edu/~tam/SelfTests/StroopEffects.html](http://www.math.unt.edu/~tam/SelfTests/StroopEffects.html).
   What was your performance time for the congruent and incongruent samples? What factors do
   you think might affect your performance? How do you think you could improve?  For full
   credit, record your answer on the Canvas HW1-Stroop Effect Survey.

3. _The MindScope Projet (10 pts)_ Read this recent paper describing the Allen Institute's
   MindScope Project: ["Inferring cortical function in the mouse visual system through
   large-scale systems neuroscience" Hawrylycz et al _PNAS_
   2016](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/27/7337)
   [(PDF)](../Resources/PNAS-2016-Hawrylycz-7337-44.pdf).  
   
   In the mammal, what are the primary three regions in which visual input is processed? Which
   is the most complex? How many different kinds of neurons are there in mouse visual cortex? 
   
   The "overarching goal of Mindscope is to understand the operations and the flexibility of
   cortical tissue in the mouse by comprehensively recording and analyzing cellular-level
   cortical responses." At what levels is this project investigating the mouse visual nervous
   system? At which of these levels do you think they have the best chance of achieving their
   goal?
