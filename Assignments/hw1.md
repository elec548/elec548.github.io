## Homework 1

_This problem set is due Thursday (9/6/2016) at 5pm. Please turn in your work by uploading to
Canvas. Preferably, I'd love to see it turned in as a Jupyter notebook with code
shown for problem 5! If you have questions, please post them on the course
forum, rather than emailing the course staff. This will allow other students
with the same question to see the response and any ensuing discussion. The first goal
of this problem set is to review the concept that complex operations involve
distributed action in the brain and to think about how best we can understand
the process of cortical computaiton. The second goal is to review molecular
neurobiology._


1. _Organization of the brain - short answer (a few sentences, 5 pts)_
   In the 1860s, Pierre Paul Broca described how patients with lesions in the posterior left
   frontal lobe (what is now called “Broca’s area”) were capable of understanding language but
   not speaking.  

   How do the symptoms of lesions in Wernicke’s area differ from those in Broca’s area?

   What happens to deaf patients ability to communicate in sign language when they suffer
   damage to Broca’s or Wernicke’s areas?

2. _The Stroop Effect (5 pts)_ Please take the Stroop effect test at
   [http://www.math.unt.edu/~tam/SelfTests/StroopEffects.html](http://www.math.unt.edu/~tam/SelfTests/StroopEffects.html).
   What was your performance time for the congruent and incongruent samples? What factors do
   you think might affect your performance? How do you think you could improve?  For full
   credit, record your answer on the Canvas HW1-Stroop Effect Survey.

3. _The MindScope Projet (10 pts)_ Read this recent paper describing the Allen Institute's
   MindScope Project: ["Inferring cortical function in the mouse visual system through
   large-scale systems neuroscience" Hawrylycz et al _PNAS_
   2016](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/27/7337)
   [(PDF)](../Resources/PNAS-2016-Hawrylycz-7337-44.pdf).  
   
   In the mammal, what are the primary three regions in which visual input is processed? Which
   is the most complex? How many different kinds of neurons are there in mouse visual cortex? 
   
   The "overarching goal of Mindscope is to understand the operations and the flexibility of
   cortical tissue in the mouse by comprehensively recording and analyzing cellular-level
   cortical responses." At what levels is this project investigating the mouse visual nervous
   system? At which of these levels do you think they have the best chance of achieving their
   goal?

4. _Neurons and Glia (10 pts)_

   Our estimates of the numbers of neurons and glia in the brain have changed over time. (If
   your curious about the history of this, see [Bartheld et al, _J Comp Neuro_ 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5063692/).
   Glia now seem potentially less important than they once did. [This paper (Sherwood et al, _PNAS_ 2006](http://www.pnas.org/content/103/37/13606.short)
   suggests one reason why there are more glia per neuron in humans than other primates. What is it?

5. _Membrane Potentials and the Nernst Equation (50 pts)_

   Refer to _PNS_ Chapter 7 for an explanation of the Nernst and Goldman equations.
   As discussed in class, a neuron’s resting potential is determined by the relative intra- and
   extra-cellular ion concentrations and the corresponding conductivities of the respective ion
   channels. For a permeable membrane, if an equilibrium is established (i.e., by active transport)
   in which the concentration of an ion is different on either side but net passive flow of ions
   in and out is zero, an electric potential (a voltage) will exist which
   represents the point at which the force of diffusion is balanced by electrostatic forces.
   The Nernst equation gives the voltage as a function of the inside and outside concentrations.

     **a.** Use the Nernst equation to fill in the equilibrium potentials for potassium, sodium,
     and chloride in the table below. (10 pts) 

     Ion | Extracellular Concentration | Intracellular Concentration | Permeability | Equilibrium Potential
     --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
     K+ |   20 mM | 400 mM | 1 | 
     Na+ | 440 mM | 50 mM | 0.04 | 
     Cl- | 560 mM | 52 mM | 0.45 | 

   When the membrane is permeable to multiple ions, the equilibrium that is established is
   similar, with the relative permeability for each ion determining its impact on the final
   membrane potential in addition to its external and internal concentrations. The Goldmann
   equation (or GHK) gives the equilbrium potential as a function of concentrations and
   relative permeabilities.

     **b.** Taking into account the potassium, sodium, and chloride concentrations, 
     calculate the resting potential of a neuron with the characteristics in the
     table above. (10 pts)

     **c.** How could you adjust the potassium level to raise the resting potential? Why does this
     work? (10 pts)

     **d.** Calculate the new extracellular potassium concentration that would be needed to bring
     the resting membrane potential to -65mV. To counteract the decrease in potassium
     concentration, the cell could insert or remove ion channels into the membrane thus
     changing the permeability ratio. How might the cell recover the original resting membrane
     potential and calculate the new permeability ratio?  (10 pts)

     **e.** Chapter 9 of _PNS_ describes the mechanisms of the action potential in detail.
     In class, we briefly connected action potentials to membrane permeability. How do the relative
     permeabilities of sodium and potasium change as an action potential is being generated?
     Consider three phases - when the membrane potentail is below threshold, and after it crosses
     threshold, after it begins to return (i.e., after the peak). (10 pts)

6. _Synapses (40 pts)_
   
   Refer to _PNS_ Ch. 10 and Ch. 12 and the Lecture 3 slides.
     
     **a.** Synapses can be either ionotropic or metabotropic. What is the difference between
     these two categories? Which are faster? 

     **b.** What are the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters?

     **c.** Rods and cones are the two main photoreceptors in the retina. They
     project to bipolar cells, who project to retinal ganglion cells which then 
     transmit information down the optic nerve to the brain.  This paper is a good
     reference - [Masland, _Nature Neuroscience_ 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn0901-877)
     What kind of synapses do cones make onto bipolar cells? How do you think this affects
     vision.

     **d.** (Hard) An important discovery was that synapses release neurotransmitter in
     quanta, which we now know correspond to vesicles. As part of the development of the quantal
     theory of neurotransmission, it was observed that the size of post-synaptic potentials
     increased in steps that were the same size as "mini-PSPs", small post-synaptic potentials
     observed in the absence of an impinging action potential. Assume that you are investigating
     plasticity in an excitatory synapse induced by some means. (i) If you see
     an increase in the EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential) but the size of mini-EPSPs
     remain constant, would you assume that the plasticity mechanism you are inducing is
     pre-synaptic or post-synaptic? (ii) What if you observe an increase in the size of
     mini-EPSPs? What is an example of a pre-synaptic plasticity mechanism? What about a
     post-synaptic plasticity mechanism?
