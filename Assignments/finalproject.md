## Final Project

The goal of the final project is to demonstrate mastery over one of the topics
of the course by replicating a key result from a published paper from the last
decade or two.  Before beginning serious work on your project, you should send a
"project abstract" email with an outline of what paper and what figure(s) you
plan to replicate. (In some cases it may be suggested to reduce the scope or
simplify the plan!) _Please do this by the end of the Thanksgiving break to
ensure you have enough time to work._

Below are some suggested / sample papers that you might consider. This is not
intended to be an exhaustive list, and students have in the past even proposed
using one of the techniques from the class on a topic of their own interest
(e.g., clustering of fantasy football players).
