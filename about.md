## Why do "Neural Signal Processing"?

_The activity of a complex network of billions of interconnected neurons underlies our ability
to sense, represent and store the details of experienced life, and enables us to interact with
our environment and other organisms. Modern neuroscience techniques enable us to access this
activity, and thus to begin to understand the processes whereby individual neurons work
together to enable complex behaviors. In order to increase this understanding and to design
biomedical systems which might therapeutically interact with neural circuits, advanced
statistical signal processing and machine learning approaches are required._


## What does ELEC548 cover?

_This class will cover a range of techniques and their application to basic neuroscience and
neural interfaces. Topics include an introduction to neurobiology and electrophysiology for
engineers, point processes, dimensionality reduction, classification/clustering, spectral
analysis, and genetic and optical tools for interrogating neural circuits. Neuroscience
applications include modeling action potentials and firing rates, automated analysis of
activity-dependent fluorescence imaging data, decoding, spike sorting, and field potential
analysis. This course is open to students with no prior neurobiology coursework._
