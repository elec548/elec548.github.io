<p><em>This problem set is due the last day of classes (12/2/2016), but can be
turned in late with no penalty. Note that we will drop the lowest score
assignment, so this is optional if you choose not to do it. Please turn in your
work by uploading to Canvas. f you have questions, please post them on the
course forum, rather than emailing the course staff. This will allow other
students with the same question to see the response and any ensuing discussion.
The goal of this problem set is to review clustering through the process of
spike sorting action potentials data. You should submit both commented code and
a write-up for this homework assignment.</em></p>

<p>The goal of this assignment is to carry out continuous neural decoding, first
just using Bayes rule and then (for extra credit) by using a <em>particle filter</em>
to account for a prior model of animal movement.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Review of generative models (30 pts)</em>
  Write down simple pseudocode for the generation of simulated data for the
  following problems.</p>

    <p><strong>Ex.</strong> Classification of data into <script type="math/tex">K</script> classes using labeled training data
 where the data are conditionally Gaussian.</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> 1. Generate a random number, k from 1, ..., K as the class
 identity. (Use the class prior probabilities to weight the choices.)

 2. Sample a random Gaussian from a Gaussian distribution with mean
 mu_k and covariance Sigma_k.
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><strong>a.</strong> Clustering data into <script type="math/tex">K</script> clusters using a mixture of Gaussians model.
 (<em>Hint: This might not be different from the example!</em>)</p>

    <p><strong>b.</strong> Dimensionality reduction from <script type="math/tex">D</script>-dimensional data to <script type="math/tex">M</script>-dimensional
 data, using probabilistic PCA.</p>

    <p><strong>c.</strong> A linear dynamical system with Gaussian initial state, innovations,
 and observation noise (i.e., the generative model for a Kalman filter).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Convexity conditions for Poisson firing rate functions (30 pts)</em>
  Consider a set of <script type="math/tex">k = 1\ldots N</script> rat hippocampal neurons in which the number
  of spikes observed  follows a Poisson distribution, <script type="math/tex">n_k \sim \text{Poisson}\!(e^{-g(x)})</script>,
  where <script type="math/tex">g(x)</script> is some function of the rat’s position <script type="math/tex">x</script>. Given an observation
  of spike counts,  <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{n} = [n_1, n_2, \ldots]^\text{T}</script>, what is the log
  likelihood function of the rats  position <script type="math/tex">x</script>? What are the first and second
  derivatives of the log likelihood with respect to <script type="math/tex">x</script>? What conditions on
  <script type="math/tex">g(x)</script> would imply that the log likelihood was concave (i.e., the second
  derivative was negative everywhere)?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Single step of dynamical system estimation (40 pts)</em>
  Consider a set of 10 neurons whose firing can be described as function of the form
  <script type="math/tex">\begin{equation*}
  n_k \sim \text{Poisson}\!\left[r_{max,k}  \exp\left(\frac{-(x - \mu_k)^2}{2\sigma_k^2}\right)\Delta_t\right].
  \end{equation*}</script>
  You will find the parameters for these neurons in the file
  <a href="hw8problem3.npz">hw8problem3.npz</a>.
  The vectors <code class="highlighter-rouge">MaxRates</code> (in spikes per second), <code class="highlighter-rouge">FieldCenters</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">FieldWidths</code>
  correspond to the values of <script type="math/tex">r_{max}</script>, <script type="math/tex">\mu</script>, and <script type="math/tex">\sigma</script> for the
  neurons, respectively. Spike counts for 250 milleseconds of neural activity is
  found in the vector <code class="highlighter-rouge">NeuralObservation</code>.</p>

    <p><strong>a.</strong> Plot the log likelihood of the rat’s position, <script type="math/tex">x</script>, over the range <script type="math/tex">[0,
 100]</script> (ignore the term(s) in the likelihood function that is common to all
 positions). What is the maximum likelihood position of the rat?</p>

    <p><strong>b.</strong> Now assume that you have prior information about the rat’s position
 characterized by a normal distribution, with mean 30 and standard deviation 5.
 On the same graph as for (a), plot the log likelihood of the rat’s position
 using just your prior distribution and using both the prior distribution and
 the observations of neural activity. What is the maximum <em>a posteriori</em>
 position of the rat?</p>
