<p><em>This problem set is due Friday (10/21/2016) at 5pm. Please turn in your work by uploading to
Canvas. f you have questions, please post them on the course forum, rather than
emailing the course staff. This will allow other students with the same question to see the
response and any ensuing discussion. The goal of this problem set is to review the basics of
point processes in general and the Poisson process in particular.</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Point Process Model Validation (30 pts)</em></p>

    <p>We can describe the number of spikes that a neuron produces in a one second
window using a wide variety of random process models. Let’s refer to the
parameters of a given model as <script type="math/tex">\theta</script>, and a set of neural counts as
<script type="math/tex">\mathbf{n}</script>. We can evaluate the quality of the model by asking for which
model/parameters the likelihood of the data, <script type="math/tex">P(\theta \mid \mathbf{n})</script>,
is maximized. In this problem you will try to determine the right model for
the spikes from a synthetic neuron.</p>

    <p><strong>a.</strong> <em>Model Comparison (10 pts)</em> Look at the data in the numpy data file
  <a href="hw4problem1A.npy">hw4problem1A.npy</a>. This file contains two variables, <code class="highlighter-rouge">SpikeTimes</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">SpikeCounts</code>.
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">SpikeTimes</code> is a list of spike times recorded in one experimental trial (each trial is 1
  s for simplicity) from a neuron.  For each trial, for convenience, the number of spikes
  is given in the corresponding element of <code class="highlighter-rouge">SpikeCount</code>. You can load the data into python
  using <code class="highlighter-rouge">numpy.load()</code>:</p>

    <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numpy</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">np</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">SpikeTimes</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">SpikeCount</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">load</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'hw4problem1A.npy'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Consider two possible models for the number of spikes per trial:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style="text-align: left">Model</th>
          <th style="text-align: left">Parameters</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left">Gaussian</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">Mean = 10.2, Variance = 9.5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left">Poisson</td>
          <td style="text-align: left">Rate = 9.8</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Using the data provided evaluate which set of parameters best describes the data. (<em>Hint:
  You should calculate the likelihood of each model. In other words, calculate the
  probability of, e.g., data from 1000 trials of the simulated data given one model or
  the other?</em>)</p>

    <p><strong>b.</strong> Now split the data into training and validation sets, use the training sets
  to train a Gaussian model and a Poisson model, and use the validation set to assess which
  model fits the data best. (<em>Hint: You should use the maximum likelihood estimate for the
  parameters of the models, which will be the sample mean and variance of the training data
  for the Gaussian and the sample mean for the Poisson.</em>)</p>

    <p><strong>c.</strong> <em>Point Processes (10 pts)</em> Consider the actual spike times from <strong>(a)</strong>
  (given in the SpikeTimes list). If you were to model this neuron with a Poisson process,
  would you use a constant or a time-varying rate over the 1 second window?
  (Justify your answer with one or more plots.)</p>

    <p><strong>d.</strong> <em>Fano Factor / ISI Distribution (10 pts)</em> Consider the spike times returned by a
  different neuron whos data are given in <a href="hw4problem1C.npy">hw4problem1C.npy</a>
  If you were to model this neuron with a Poisson process, would you use a constant or a
  time- varying rate? Do the variance and mean of the count distribution have the
  relationship you would expect for a Poisson process? What physiological process might you
  observe in the spike times that would explain this? (<em>Hint: You’ll want to actually look
  at the spike times. Generating a peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) showing the average
  number of spikes in small bins of time will help explain your observations.</em>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Describing Real Data (60 pts)</em></p>

    <p>In this problem you are going to characterize the <a href="#datasource">neural activity recorded
on a multielectrode array in visual cortex</a>, found in
<a href="hw4problem2.npy">hw4problem2.npy</a>.  Spike times (in microseconds) for 10 neurons are given
in <code class="highlighter-rouge">spiketimes</code>, a 10 element numpy array, where each element is a numpy vector of
spiketimes.  The time-varying stimulus is described in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">stimulus</code> numpy array, where the
first column is timestamps (which follow regular 5 ms steps) and the second column is the
direction of motion (in degrees) of a moving bar. Stimulus directions are randomized, each
direction is maintained for 4 s, and directions are repeated 8 times. You can load the data
into python using <code class="highlighter-rouge">numpy.load()</code>:</p>

    <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numpy</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">np</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">stimulus</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">spiketimes</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">load</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'hw4problem2.npy'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><strong>a.</strong> (10 pts) Neural activity in visual cortex was recorded while the cat
  was viewing drifting bars (like in the Hubel and Weisel video) that
  cycled through different angles. The visual stimulus was constant for
  4s, and then changed (the angle of the stimulus in 5 ms bins is given
  in the stimulus vector). Plot the “tuning curve” for the activity from the 10th
  neuron, show how the mean number of spikes varies as a function of the
  direction of the moving bar. (The x-axis should be stimulus direction and the
  y-axis should be “average spikes per second”.) Does this neuron have one
  “preferred direction”?  Why might the directional tuning be shaped the way it
  is?</p>

    <p><strong>b.</strong> (10 pts) Calculate the tuning curves for all the neurons. Plot a histogram
  of the “preferred direction” (i.e., direction of stimulus which produces
  maximum average spiking) of the neurons. Plot a histogram of the “maximum
  firing rate” (i.e., the average firing rate for the preferred direction).</p>

    <p><strong>c.</strong> (10 pts) Select the neuron with the largest maximum firing rate.
  For each stimulus direction, calculate the mean spiking rate and the variance
  from this mean in the number of spikes observed in one stimulus presentation.
  Calculate the Fano factor for each stimulus direction and compare to what is
  expected for a Poisson process. Repeat for the neuron with the largest average
  (i.e., across all directions) firing rate.</p>

    <p><strong>d.</strong> (10 pts) For the neurons in part (c), create ISI distributions for
  spikes during stimuli in the preferred direction. Compare this to the ISI
  distribution expected under a Poisson approximation.</p>

    <p><strong>e.</strong> (20 pts) For the neurons in part (c), use the time-rescaling
  theorem to renormalize the ISIs for all stimulus directions (i.e., assuming a
  piece-wise constant inhomogeneous Poisson process). Plot the resulting ISI
  distribution. Conduct a goodness-of-fit test on the spikes. Is the piece-wise
  Poisson model a good one?</p>

<p>This data is courtesy of Tim Blanche, UC Berkeley. He captured single and multiunit recordings
in the primary visual cortex of cats during viewing of simple and complex stimuli.  It has been
shared for public use on the CRCNS.org website as data set “pvc3”, and we are using the data
from the “drifting bar” section.</p>
