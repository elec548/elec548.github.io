<p><em>This problem set is due Tuesday (10/4/2016) at 5pm. Please turn in your work by uploading to
Canvas. f you have questions, please post them on the course forum, rather than
emailing the course staff. This will allow other students with the same question to see the
response and any ensuing discussion. The goal of this problem set is to review the basics of
point processes in general and the Poisson process in particular.</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Properties of the Poisson Random Processes (30 pts)</em></p>

    <p>It is not uncommon for the action potential waveforms from multiple neurons
to be recorded on a single electrode. Imagine that exactly two neurons are
contributing spikes to the signal you are recording. Each neuron is spiking
independently according to a Poisson process with rate <script type="math/tex">\lambda_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">\lambda_2</script>
respectively.</p>

    <p><strong>a.</strong> The raw spike train recorded on the electrode is a Poisson process. Show
that it has an exponential ISI distribution. (<em>Hint: What is Pr(combined
signal &gt; t), which is 1 – CDF, in terms of the same quantity for each of the
neurons?</em>)</p>

    <p><strong>b.</strong> What is the rate of this Poisson process?</p>

    <p><strong>c.</strong> What is the probability that each neuron will spike once within the same 1 ms interval?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Describing Simulated Data (30 pts).</em></p>

    <p>In this problem, we will investigate how spikes generated by the
Connor-Stevens neuron from the previous homework compare to a Poisson process.
Use the Connor-Stevens neuron with smoothed–Gaussian random input as in HW2
(but with new parameters). Generate 100 trials per parameter combination rather
than 25. For the mean input, use {0.1 μA, 0.2 μA}; for the standard deviation (after
smoothing!), use {0.2 μA , 0.5 μA). Under what input conditions (mean and variance) are the
spikes that are produced “most” like a Poisson process? (Show spike count and ISI
distributions, comparing data to expected distributions.) Under what input conditions are
the spikes “least” like a Poisson process?</p>
